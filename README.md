# Java Vending Machine Project 
This project is a Java-based vending machine simulator that allows users to interact with a command-line interface to purchase items and receive change.

The vending machine allows users to browse the list of available items and select their desired product by entering the corresponding item number. Once an item is selected, the user can insert money into to the machine and make a payment. If the payment is sufficient, the vending machine dispenses the item and returns any change owed to the user. If the payment is not sufficient, the vending machine asks the user to insert more money.
